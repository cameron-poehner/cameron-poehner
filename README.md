# Cameron Poehner <br>

Web Developer with a proven passion for collaborating with clients, to design and develop beautiful, reusable UI components that effectively communicate with users. I recently collaborated with a fledgeling Nonprofit called Drum Church to design a custom UI in Figma and developed a CI/CD Pipeline through Github Actions to Netlify to continue making iterative improvements in user communication. Constantly seeking growth, I am continuing to learn and implement UI/UX design trends and create better React applications by completing courses available on Udemy. I am eager to apply my passion for collaborating with fellow developers to engineer solutions for the modern web and delivering concise communication to improve the UX.
